# Overview
In this iteration, we completed the first feature: User Log In & Sign Up (3 completed pages)

When you open our application, you first enter the welcome page, where you're given the option to log in as a returning user("Already Planning") or create an account if you're new to the application("Get Started").
- When you click "Already Planning", you're led to the page where you can enter your school email and password, if the credentials are incorrect, then you'll get a pop up that's its incorrect. However, if your credentials are correct, then you will enter the main page. You're also able to go back to the welcome page through the backspace button.
- When you click "Get Started", you're led to the page where you create an account, if your email is already in the system, then you're a existing user and will get a pop message. If your passwords are not a match, then you'll get a pop up message that they do not match.Lastly, if everything is good, then you'll be led to the main page. You're also able to go back to the welcome page through the backspace button.

All buttons in the main page are functioning, but the pages are not, they will lead you to an "Under Construction" page, where we will finish those to be their associated feature in the following iterations. In this page, you're also able to go back to the welcome page through the log out button.


Notes:
If you don't want to register and make an account, you can use the following example users that we have made:

for user1: username: Huynhnt@myumanitoba.ca | password: password

for user2: username: user@myumanitoba.ca | password: password1
