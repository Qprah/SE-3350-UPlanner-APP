# Iteration 1 Retrospective
## What Went Well:
- Division of our group was even (3 front end and 2 backend) 
- Within the 2 groups, we were able to work together and eventually get things working on both ends
- We got something running and working in the end 
- Communication within and outside the groups to help each other 
- The UI looks better than expected. 

# What Didn't Go Well:
- Did not meet in person enough within the individual groups as much as we wanted 
- Lacked with planning, like with our developer tasks in our features 
- Little to no commenting within our code 
- A lot of code smells (cluttered code), especially with the UI portion. 
- Did not confirm requirements hence violating database stub setup conditions 
- Standard programming were forgotten throughout the iteration

# Actions to Improve:
- Make more meetings to code in real time and to constantly update on our progress 2 days a week)
- Plan more: soft deadlines, properly assigned developer tasks, use time estimates in Git to help with time estimates next iteration.
- We have some technical debt: need to comment, reorganize our code (especially our XML files)
