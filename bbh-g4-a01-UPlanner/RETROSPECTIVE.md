# Retrospective
## Overview: 
In iteration 2, we focused on having more face-to-face meetings and carefully planning our major tasks. While we saw improvements in these areas, there's no online evidence of our progress since much of our communication happened over phone calls. 
However, in iteration 2, our performance suffered mainly because we made significant changes across three different branches without pulling code beforehand and communicating with the team about our big changes, causing complicated issues when merging them together.  

 

## What Did Not Go Successful 
We made significant changes across three different branches. We weren't aware of the code written by developers in other branches; therefore, we couldn't combine all the completed features into one development branch. 
Although we fulfilled most of our commitments for Iteration 2 and everything was functional, the tasks were spread across multiple branches and couldn't be merged in time to create a single, functional branch. 
Since our focus was on completing features, we failed to make unit tests that cover our business layer because of our lack of understanding of what we needed done, thinking we needed complete other aspects prior to testing. 

 

## Concrete Ways of Improvement
By addressing these areas for improvement, we aim to enhance communication, collaboration, streamline development process and delivery more effectively in iteration 3.

### Areas for Improvement:
Enhanced Communication Strategy 
We must communicate with the team about major pushes, branch-outs and task plans. This will ensure that every team member is aware of these updates to avoid confusion and merging conflicts. 
We will also schedule more regular meetings (on all or in person) to discuss our progress, challenges and upcoming tasks. We will document often as well to notified members that aren’t available at the time. 

Unified Branch Workflow 
- We must transition to a single, designated development branch for the iteration where all team members collaborate on features. This streamlines the merging processes and reduces the risk of conflicts. 
- We will also implement a “pull and run” protocol, which requires all team members to fetch the latest changes and run the code locally before making any modifications. This helps identify and address issues early on. 

Frequent Soft Deadlines 
- We will introduce soft deadlines throughout the iteration to allow team members time to regroup, review progress and get everyone on the same page. 
- We will regularly be reassessing our priorities and adjusting accordingly will maintain alignment towards our iteration goals. 

Code Freeze Protocol 
- We will be enforcing a code freeze before the official iteration 3 deadline, which will prevent last-minute conflicts and ensure a stable codebase. 

More focus on integration and testing 
- We will run tests with coverage to also keep track of our progress. 

We will reassess our priorities and make sure all team members understand what unit tests are, so we can have more test coverage in our business layer. Therefore, we can achieve at least 80% test coverage.
